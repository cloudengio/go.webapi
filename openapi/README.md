# openapi

This repository provides support for traversing openapi documents as parsed
by https://github.com/getkin/kin-openapi and also for performing various
transformations on those documents to work around inconsistent/incorrect
schemas (see the transforms package). Such schemas are often generated
by schema generator tools that generate specifications from existing
code/APIs.
